I developed a voice-powered AI customer support assistant using Vapi.ai for an online electronics store. The assistant allows users to ask about specific products, prices, and availability.

🔧 Tools :
Vapi.ai – for real-time voice recognition and conversational AI

Google Sheets – used as a live product database (no-code backend)

Mock Electronics Product Catalog Natural Language Understanding – assistant understands variations of user queries like:

“Do you have the iPhone 14 in stock?”

“What's the price of the MacBook Air M2?”

“Tell me about gaming laptops.”
